### 14 bit midi functionality and helper functions

14 bit midi functionality and helper functions for the same. Some of this is builds on the original work of Carl Testa's great [FourteenBitCC class](https://gist.github.com/carltesta/bb5065a7b92bab7673237e9cc1c9a612) but with extended functionality and convenience.

See the help file for information about the functionality and use of this extension.

As an alternative to this quark, you could use the 14 bit midi functionality in [The Modality Toolkit](https://github.com/ModalityTeam/Modality-toolkit).

### Installation

Open up SuperCollider and evaluate the following line of code:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/cc14")`
